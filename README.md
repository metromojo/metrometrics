# metrometrics
Predicting battery degradation on King Country Metro's hybrid busses with geographic data. 

## Use cases
metrometrics serves two specific use cases through calculation of battery degredation per bus route. 

1. By quantifying the average battery degredation cost per trip (or day) on a specific bus route, route planners can optimize for energy efficiency and matinence costs in selection of future route options. 

2. Prediction of lifespan for specific battery modules on each bus allows
